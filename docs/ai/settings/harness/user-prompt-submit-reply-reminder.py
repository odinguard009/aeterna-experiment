"""UserPromptSubmit hook that injects the slackbot-v2 Opus reply reminder
as additionalContext on every turn.

Slackbot v2 is a stateless pipe: plain assistant text never reaches Slack.
Opus-class models tend to answer with plain text anyway, so a per-turn
reminder nudges them to call a terminal mcp__slackbot__* tool instead.

Delivering the reminder via a UserPromptSubmit hook (rather than
concatenating a <system-reminder>-wrapped suffix into the user turn text)
lets the CLI's normalizeMessagesForAPI / shouldUseMidConvSystem promote it
to a real {role:"system"} turn on models that accept mid-conversation
system messages (opus-4-8, mythos, fable, …) and fall back to the
<system-reminder> wrap on those that don't. The CLI owns that model gate;
this hook does not re-implement it.

Installed for slackbot v2 sessions: env-manager registers it in
launcher-settings.json only when CCR_OPUS_REMINDER_HOOK_BODY is set, and
CCR sets that env var only when the session is Slack-originated and the
ccr_slackbot_v2_system_turn_reminder GrowthBook boolean is on. Registered
as a UserPromptSubmit hook so it fires on every user turn (seed included).

The Opus-class gate lives here (is_opus on the transcript's most recent
main-loop assistant model): the
configured model can fall back CLI-side per request, so the effective
model is only knowable at runtime from the transcript. A non-Opus or
indeterminate model emits nothing — the hook is a no-op.
